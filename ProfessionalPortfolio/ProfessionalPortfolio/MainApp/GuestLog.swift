/*
 Want to have a "Sign My Guest Log" link in a space somewhere on the screen that will:
 1. Display the pins for all users that have signed the guest log.
 2. Prompt for permission to use the user's location.
 3. Present a text box that prompts them to â€œIntroduce yourself, give feedback, or say anything."
 4. Submit the GPS location and text feedback when submitted.
 5. Tapping on a pin will show the text feedback that was submitted by the user at that location.
 6. Have an AI summary of all user feedback displayed near where the button to sign the guest book is.
